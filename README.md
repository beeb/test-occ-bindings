I copied the contents of https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT/tree/master/src into the `occt` folder.

When doing `cargo run`, there are lots of errors related to `undefined reference`s and also

```
some `extern` functions couldn't be found; some native libraries may need to be installed or have their path specified
```
